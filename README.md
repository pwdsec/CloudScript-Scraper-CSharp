# CloudScript Scraper C#
CloudScript Scraper made in c#

Takes less codes in C# than C++ so why not.
It gets the Lua Script in Base64 Decode it and then show the source. It will also create a folder "Script" and put all the sources there that you have checked. I added bruteforce too but low-key useless: just go here: <a href="https://lynx.rip/dashboard/home/cloudscripts/storage/">cloudscripts/storage/</a> you will have access to all the codes.
